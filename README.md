# Things to consider:

- Error handling (404 errors for images)
- how will we handle missing/incomplete info for titles, authors and images?
- how do we want to account for different image sizes?
- check for repeated data in the api?

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
